# DK MAP

This is a web collaborative web map for Tabletop Role Playing Game (TTRPG).

It's being made using React + Typescript + SCSS for Frontend features and connected to Firebase Realtime Database.

# Current Version

It can be accessed at [https://dkmap.netlify.app/](https://dkmap.netlify.app/)
* Since it's being used basically for personal games, currently I'm using map images provided in [https://www.daggerheart.com/](Daggerheart open beta), I don't own any art used from their assets
* No login is necessary to add content since the main goal, as for now, is to play with friends. So keep in mind that, if you add anything, it will be kept there for everyone to see it
  * In case you want to have some data deleted, please send an email to jposawa@gmail.com with data's exact name, so I can delete it

## Future plans
* Add original maps
* Study the possibility of implementation for data relationship between map data and groups/users
  * I'm not sure if, at least in this point, it's something that would be worth doing or a priority
